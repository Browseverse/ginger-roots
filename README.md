# Ginger Roots

Ginger Roots is a fork of the incredible Roots Theme mixed together with [{{Mustache}}](http://mustache.github.com/) templates.
It uses [Mustache.php](https://github.com/bobthecow/mustache.php) to wrap and convert existing .php templates into
.mustache files.

## Mustache Theme support

Many of the built-in Mustache features are supported, plus wordpress-specific adaptation, including:

* i18n via custom `{{#__}}{{/__}}` tags
* partials `{{> }}` to include other templates
* Wordpress foundations such as the loop (via `{{#the_loop}}`)
* Pre-populated wordpress context data, e.g. `{{is_singular}}`, `{{the_permalink}}`

* All mustache templates are located inside `templates` folder
* Templates correspond to their .php counterparts, i.e. there is `page.php` which uses `templates/page.mustache`
* New templates can be created even without a php counterpart, as long as they don't need new context data

## Why Mustache?

Because it's neat. Wordpress and PHP are very powerful, but adjusting php templates embedded with html can easily become messy.
Mustache forces you to split application logic and presentation in a nice way. 

## Quick start

* Clone the git repo - `git clone git://github.com/gingerlime/roots.git` - or [download it](https://github.com/gingerlime/roots/zipball/master)
* Read [Theme Activation](https://github.com/retlehs/roots/wiki/Theme-activation) to understand everything that happens once you activate Roots

Ginger Roots specifics:

Terms:

* Rootache - the very unattractive name for the Mustache.php sub-class used in Ginger Roots
* template / $template - the mustache template, before rendering
* context / $context - the 'storage space' for all data used to render the template. Typically a $context is a Rootache
  instance.

Editing Templates:

* Hack away any file in templates/

Adding data or logic:

* Use the appropriate php file to add data to the context
* Extend the Rootache class
